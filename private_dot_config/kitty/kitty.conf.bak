#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: list-fonts` command. By default they are derived automatically, by
#: the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font
#: families that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick,
#: etc. For example::

#:     font_family      Operator Mono Book
#:     bold_font        Operator Mono Medium
#:     italic_font      Operator Mono Book Italic
#:     bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic

font_size 11.0
background_opacity .9

adjust_line_height  100%
# adjust_column_width 0

#: Change the size of each character cell kitty renders. You can use
#: either numbers, which are interpreted as pixels or percentages
#: (number followed by %), which are interpreted as percentages of the
#: unmodified values. You can use negative pixels or percentages less
#: than 100% to reduce sizes (but this might cause rendering
#: artifacts).

#: Map the specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful
#: if you need special rendering for some symbols, such as for
#: Powerline. Avoids the need for patched fonts. Each unicode code
#: point is specified in the form U+<code point in hexadecimal>. You
#: can specify multiple code points, separated by commas and ranges
#: separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple
#: times. Syntax is::

# symbol_map Symbols Nerd Font 

# disable_ligatures never

#: Choose how you want to handle multi-character ligatures. The
#: default is to always render them.  You can tell kitty to not render
#: them when the cursor is over them by using cursor to make editing
#: easier, or have kitty never render them at all by using always, if
#: you don't like them. The ligature strategy can be set per-window
#: either using the kitty remote control facility or by defining
#: shortcuts for it in kitty.conf, for example::

#:     map alt+1 disable_ligatures_in active always
#:     map alt+2 disable_ligatures_in all never
#:     map alt+3 disable_ligatures_in tab cursor
  
  # symbol_map U+f101-U+f208 nonicon
  disable_ligatures never
